## Welcome to AQ 232

This course covers the fundamental concepts and methods used in fish stock assessments, including population dynamics, data collection, and analytical approaches for sustainable fisheries management.


## Course Modules

### Module 1: Course Introduction
- Introduction to population dynamics
- Introduction to stock assessment
- Aim of stock assessment
- Definition of key terms

### Module 2: Data used in Stock Assessment
- Types of data used in stock assessment
- Fishery-Dependent Data
- Fishery-Independent Data
- Data Requirements for Stock Assessments
- Data Quality and Uncertainty

### Module 3: Population Dynamics
- Basic concepts of fish population dynamics
- Population structure
  - Age structure
  - Size structure
  - Sex ratio
- Vital rates
  - Birth (Recruitment)
  - Death (Mortality)
  - Growth
- Population models
- Surplus production models
- Age-structured population models
- Equilibrium versus dynamic concepts
- Length-based assessment methods


### Module 4: The Unit Stock
- **Distribution and Abundance**
  - Geographic distribution of fish populations
  - Spatial and temporal variation in abundance
  - Habitat requirements and factors affecting distribution
  - Environmental influences on stock distribution
- **Methods of Estimating Fish Stock Abundance**
  - Direct methods (surveys and sampling)
  - Catch per unit effort (CPUE) indices
  - Mark-recapture and tagging studies
  - Acoustic surveys
  - Visual surveys and underwater observation
  - Population estimation models
  - Biomass indices and standardized indices
  






- **[Lecture 2: Advanced Data Topics](lectures/lecture2.html)** - Data quality, biological data collection, data management, effort standardization, gear selectivity, sampling design, and environmental data.



## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the principles of fish population dynamics
- Identify appropriate data collection methods for stock assessments
- Apply statistical methods to analyze fishery data
- Evaluate stock status and provide management recommendations
- Consider ecosystem and social dimensions of fisheries management
