species that live together in a particular area\n- A fish population is a group of fish of the same species that live in a particular area.\n\n\n##  [Introduction to population dynamics]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Fish population dynamics** describes the ways in which a given fishery population grows and shrinks over time, as controlled by **birth**, **death**, and **migration**\n\n- It is a basis for understanding changes of fishery patterns and issues such as **habitat destruction**, **predation** and **optimal harvesting rates**\n\n- The population dynamics of fisheries is used by fisheries scientists to determine sustainable yields.\n\n\n##  [Introduction to population dynamics]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n+ Population dynamics is a branch of life science dealing with the short and long-term changes in the size and age composition of populations, and the biological and environmental processes influencing those changes.\n\n- It deals with the way populations are affected by *birth* and *death rates*, and by *immigration and emigration*.\n\n## [Introduction to Stock assessment]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Stock assessment** is examination of development of fish stock using mathematical and statistical models to make quantitative predictions in order to address fisheries management issues.\n\n- **Stock assessment** is the process of collecting and analyzing demographic information about fish populations in order to describe the conditions or status of fish stock\n\n\n\n## [Aim of stock assessment]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- Assessment of the current state of stock\n- Assessment of the past stock situation\n- Predictions to the future stock based on management choices\n- An estimation of the rate at which it is being removed due to harvesting etc.\n\n\n## [Aim of stock assessment...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- Stock assessment describe a range of life history characteristics for a given species\n    + It includes age, growth, natural mortality, sexual maturity and reproduction, stock boundaries, diet preferences, habitat characteristics, species interactions, and environmental factors that may affect the species\n\n- Assessment also include descriptions of the fishery for a species, using information from both scientists and fishermen\n\n\n## [Definition of key terms]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n+ **Fish Catch** is the total number or weight of fish captured from an area over a period of time. \n- This includes fish that are caught but released or discarded instead of being landed.\n+ **Carrying Capacity** is amount of fish that a specific habitat can support.\n\n+ **Bycatch** is the harvest of fish or animals other than the species for which the fishing gear was intended\n\n\n## [Definition of key terms...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE)** is the quantity of fish caught (in number or in weight) with one standard unit of fishing effort.\n- Effort can be number of fishing gear or vessel, length of time used during fishing, number of fishermen etc.\n\n- e.g. number of fish taken per 1000 hooks per day or weight of fish taken per hour of trawling. \n\n- CPUE is often considered as an index of fish biomass (or abundance).\n\n- CPUE is also referred to as **catch rate**\n\n\n\n## [Definition of key terms...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Effort** is the amount of time and fishing power used to harvest fish. \n\n- Fishing power includes gear size, boat size, and horsepower.\n\n- **Fish Density** is the number of fish per unit area.\n\n- **Spawning** the number of eggs and sperm released into water by fish.\n\n- **Spawning rate** is the number of eggs and sperm released per unit time\n\n\n## [Definition of key terms...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Cohort** is a group of fish spawned during a given period, usually within a year\n\n- **Recruitment** the number of new young fish that enter a population in a given year.\n\n- **Morphometrics** these are measurements which characterize the form, shape and appearance of a fish. \n\n- Difference in morphometrics, such as colouration, can be used to distinguish different stocks of the same species.\n\n\n\n## [Definition of key terms...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Maximum sustainable yield (MSY)** is theoretical harvest of a fish species that can be taken over an indefinite period. \n\n- **MSY** theoretically aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population. \n\n- **MSY** has been widely criticized and has led to the collapse of many fisheries, as it ignores size, age, reproductive capacity, and fishing effort.\n\n\n## [Definition of key terms...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n\n- **Fish mortality** is a parameter that account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. \n\n- The mortality can be divided into two types;\n\n  - **Natural mortality** -- the removal of fish from stock due to causes not associated with fishing.\n  \n  - Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish.\n  \n  - In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M)\n\n  \n## [Definition of key terms...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n\n- **Fishing mortality** -- the removal of fish from stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.\n\n- It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models.\n\n- **Mortality rate** or **death rate** is a measure of the number of deaths in a particular population per unit time. \n\n- Mortality rate is the rate at which fish die, typically shown as a percentage. \n\n- **Survival rate** is a measure of number of alive fishes in a particular population per unit time\n\n\n\n## [Definition of key terms...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n\n- If 1,000 fish are alive at the beginning of the year and 200 fish die, leaving

during the spawning season.\n\n- The number of eggs produced by a fish differs in different species, and depends on the size and age of the fish. \n\n- It is a measure of the reproductive capacity of a female fish\n\n## [Definition of key terms...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Gonadosomatic index (GSI)** is a metric that represents the relative weight of the gonad to the fish weight.\n\n- GSI has been widely used to evaluate reproduction timing (Lowerre-Barbieri et al., 2011) \n\n- Changes in GSI are mostly determined by variations in yolk concentration during different oocyte stages\n\n- Therefore, it provides information about maturation and seasonal patterns in gonad development\n\n\n## [Definition of key terms...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color:
