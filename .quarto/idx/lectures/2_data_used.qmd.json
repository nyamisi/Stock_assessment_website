Fishery-dependent data\n1. Fishery-independent data\n  \n\n## [Fishery-Dependent Data]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"} \n\n**Overview**\n\nFishery-dependent data comes directly from the fishing process itself. Common sources include:\n\n- Self-reporting by fishers\n- Onboard observers accompanying fishing vessels\n- Portside surveys and sampling\n- Telephone surveys\n- Vessel-monitoring systems\n\n## [Fishery-Independent Data]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Overview**\n\nFishery-independent data comes from research activities that do not involve harvesting fish. These include:\n\n- Research surveys using standardized gear (trawls, seines, acoustic, video, and side-scan sonar)\n- Tagging experiments\n- Acoustic surveys to detect fish abundance using specialized detectors \n\n## [Data Requirements for Stock Assessments]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\nSuccessful stock assessments require three key types of data:\n\n1. **Catch data** – information on harvested fish\n1. **Relative abundance data** – indices of stock size\n1. **Life history data** – species's age, growth, and maturity information\n\nBoth fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sources contribute to meeting these requirements.\n\n# [Fishery-Dependent Data]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n## [Landing Records]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\nLanding records are among the most common fishery-dependent data sources:\n\n- Records result directly from the sale of caught fish at ports\n- Typically provide information on **landed catch only**\n- Usually recorded as **total weight** rather than number of individual fish\n- Often supplemented by port samples for biological information\n\n## [Portside Sampling]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Definition and purpose**\n\nPortside sampling involves collecting biological data from a portion of the catch at landing sites:\n\n- Conducted by government scientists called **portside observers** or **port agents**\n- Samples are measured for **size** and **age** information\n- For recreational fisheries, this is referred to as a **creel survey**\n\n**Data collection methods**\n\n- Fish size is measured directly at the dock\n- Age is determined by counting growth rings in fish scales or otoliths (ear bones), similar to counting tree rings \n\n\n\n## [Onboard Observers]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Purpose**\n\nOnboard observers are government personnel who accompany commercial fishing vessels to:\n\n- Monitor how fishermen interact with target and non-target species\n- Collect detailed information about catch composition\n\n**Data collected**\n\n- Sample catch for **size** and **age** information\n- Estimate **bycatch** (incidental catches of non-target species)\n- Estimate **discards** (fish returned to the sea) \n\n\n## [Log Books and Vessel Trip Reports]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Overview**\n\nFishermen may be required or encouraged to keep their own records:\n\n- **Log books** and **vessel trip reports** document fishing activities\n- Maintained either as mandatory requirement or organized voluntary effort\n\n**Reliability and applications**\n\n- Less reliable than landing records and onboard observer data for estimating catch weight and numbers\n- Valuable for determining **spatial distribution** of fishing effort\n- Useful for tracking **fishing effort** across seasons and areas\n- Some fisheries use **vessel monitoring systems (VMS)** – electronic devices that automatically record vessel location and movements \n\n## [Telephone Surveys]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Primary method** for collecting data on recreational fisheries\n- Also widely used for **small-scale fisheries** to record catch numbers, location, and size information\n- Provides complementary data when on-site sampling is impractical\n\n\n\n# [Fishery-Independent Data]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n## [Research Survey Approaches]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- Research surveys provide data independent of fishing activities\n- Scientists use **standardized sampling gear**: trawls, seines, hydroacoustics, and video\n- Samples are collected throughout the potential range of target fish\n\n**Survey Flexibility**\n\n- Can target multiple species or focus on a single species\n- Can target specific life stages (e.g., juvenile year classes)\n\n**Data Benefits**\n\n- Provide abundance indices for stock assessment\n- Collect size, age, and maturity information from the stock\n\n\n## [Mark and Recapture Studies]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- A specialized research method for estimating population parameters\n- Provides estimates of:\n  - Fish movement and migration patterns\n  - Growth rates\n  - Natural mortality\n  - Discard mortality\n\n\n\n## [Fisheries Frame Survey]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff;

color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Temporal Snapshot**\n\n- Provide **static information** valid only at the time of the survey\n- Represent a single **snapshot** of the fishery\n\n**Impact of Changes**\n\n- Rapid changes to the fishery compromise accuracy:\n  - Changes in number of fishing boats\n  - Introduction of new fishing gear types\n  - Shifts in fishing effort or patterns\n- Such changes make raising factors unreliable for estimating total effort\n\n\n## [Data Integration in Fish Stock Assessment]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Key Data Components**\n\n1. **Fisheries Statistics** – catch and effort data\n1. **Frame Survey Data** – fleet and gear information\n1. **Biological Data** – from research surveys and port sampling\n\n**Application**\n\n- These data are integrated to develop predictive models\n- Models assess current stock status under various conditions\n- Enable managers to evaluate impacts of different management strategies\n\n\n\n# [Catch Assessment Surveys (CAS)]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff;
