Understanding the distribution, abundance, and methods for estimating these parameters is critical for effective stock assessment and sustainable fisheries management.\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: Distribution and Abundance\n\n### 1.1 Geographic Distribution of Fish Populations\n\n**Definition:** Geographic distribution refers to the spatial area where a fish stock is found, including the boundaries of its range.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Fish populations are not uniformly distributed across all suitable habitats\n- Distribution patterns change seasonally (spawning, feeding, wintering areas)\n- Some species have discrete distributions while others have overlapping ranges\n- Distribution limits are determined by temperature, salinity, bathymetry, and food availability\n\n**Examples:**\n- Migratory species (salmon) move between coastal and riverine habitats\n- Demersal species (bottom-dwelling) have specific depth distributions\n- Pelagic species distribute widely in open water\n\n**Management Implications:**\n- Fishing effort should target areas of highest concentration\n- Seasonal closures may protect aggregations during vulnerable periods\n- International boundaries may complicate management of stocks crossing borders\n\n---\n\n### 1.2 Spatial and Temporal Variation in Abundance\n\n**Temporal Variation:**\n- **Seasonal changes** - Abundance fluctuates with feeding, spawning, and migration cycles\n- **Interannual variation** - Year-to-year changes in recruitment and survival\n- **Long-term trends** - Decadal-scale changes related to fishing pressure or environmental conditions\n\n**Spatial Variation:**\n- **Patchiness** - Fish concentrate in certain areas (spawning grounds, feeding areas)\n- **Gradients** - Density changes across depth, latitude, or habitat types\n- **Hotspots** - Areas of consistently high abundance\n\n**Measurement Challenges:**\n- Detecting aggregations requires spatially intensive sampling\n- Small-scale variability requires high sampling effort to quantify accurately\n- Temporal dynamics require time series of observations\n\n---\n\n### 1.3 Habitat Requirements and Factors Affecting Distribution\n\n**Abiotic Factors:**\n- **Temperature** - Most critical factor; thermal preferences vary by species\n- **Salinity** - Freshwater, brackish, or marine preferences\n- **Dissolved oxygen** - Required for respiration; anaerobic zones are avoided\n- **Bathymetry** - Depth preferences related to light and pressure tolerance\n- **Substrate type** - Bottom type affects benthic food availability\n\n**Biotic Factors:**\n- **Food availability** - Distribution follows food resources\n- **Predation risk** - Avoidance of predator-rich areas\n- **Competition** - Space partitioning with other species\n- **Reproductive habitat** - Essential for spawning and nursery grounds\n\n**Habitat Quality:**\n- Optimal habitat supports higher population densities\n- Marginal habitat may be temporarily occupied but has lower reproductive success\n- Loss or degradation of critical habitat can limit population size\n\n---\n\n### 1.4 Environmental Influences on Stock Distribution\n\n**Physical Oceanography:**\n- Ocean currents transport larvae and affect distribution\n- Upwelling events create productive feeding areas\n- Coastal current patterns structure population distributions\n\n**Climate and Weather:**\n- Climate change shifts suitable habitat ranges\n- Seasonal weather events (storms, cold snaps) cause temporary distribution changes\n- Long-term climate trends alter distribution boundaries\n\n**Environmental Monitoring:**\n- Temperature and oxygen monitoring identify suitable habitat\n- Satellite data tracks ocean color, temperature, and currents\n- Integrated environmental monitoring helps predict abundance changes\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Methods of Estimating Fish Stock Abundance\n\n### 2.1 Direct Methods (Surveys and Sampling)\n\n**Trawl Surveys:**\n- Bottom or mid-water trawling in systematic grid pattern\n- Standardized vessels, gear, and protocols ensure comparability\n- Provides age/size composition data\n- Index of relative abundance (CPUE)\n- **Advantages:** Direct observation, compositional data\n- **Disadvantages:** Gear selectivity, avoidance behavior, high cost\n\n**Dredges and Dip Nets:**\n- For benthic and demersal species\n- Smaller spatial coverage than trawls\n- High observation effort per area\n\n**Seining and Gillnetting:**\n- Specialized methods for coastal and nearshore areas\n- Often used in smaller-scale fisheries\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) Indices\n\n**Definition:** CPUE is the catch obtained per standardized unit of fishing effort.\n\n**Formula:**\n$$\\text{CPUE} = \\frac{\\text{Total Catch}}{\\text{Total Effort}}$$\n\nWhere effort could be:\n- Fishing hours\n- Days at sea\n- Number of hooks (for longline)\n- Distance trawled\n- Number of traps\n\n**Standardization:**\n- Raw CPUE must be standardized for differences in:\n  - Vessel characteristics (size, power, technology)\n  - Seasonal effects\n  - Geographic area\n  - Environmental variables\n- Generalized Linear Models (GLM) or other statistical methods used\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Uses existing commercial fishing data\n- Cost-effective\n- Long time series available\n- Real-time updates possible\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Affected by fisher behavior (targeting, avoidance)\n- Changes in technology affect catchability\n- Assumes effort is independent\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Mark-Recapture and Tagging Studies\n\n**Basic Principle:**\n1. Capture, mark, and release a known number of fish (N₁)\n2. Recapture a sample (n₂)\n3. Count marked individuals in recapture (m)\n4.
