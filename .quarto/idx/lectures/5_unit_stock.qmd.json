color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **A unit stock** is a population of fish, either of a single or different species, grouped together for assessment purposes which may or may not include all the fish in a stock. \n- A unit stock is a group of fish that:\n\n  - **Share a common gene pool** -- can interbreed\n  - **Occupy a defined geographical area** -- have a specific distribution\n  - **Exhibit similar life history traits** -- growth, reproduction, mortality\n  - **Are subject to similar fishing pressures** -- exploited by the same fisheries\n  - **Are managed as a single entity** -- for conservation and exploitation, -- Can be managed independently from other stocks\n\n## [Determination of a Unit Stock]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- Unit stocks can be determined through various biological and ecological characteristics, including:\n\n  - Distribution patterns -- Where unit stocks are located\n  - Spawning behavior -- Different stocks spawn in different areas\n  - Population parameters -- Recruitment, growth and mortality rates, morphometric differences\n  - Physiological traits -- Temperature at hatching, vertebrae structure, scale decorations, parasite types\n\n\n## [Distribution and Abundance]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n### [Geographic Distribution]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Geographic distribution** refers to the spatial area where a fish stock is found, including the boundaries of its range.\n\n**Key concepts:**\n\n- Fish populations are not uniformly distributed across all suitable habitats\n- Distribution patterns change seasonally (spawning, feeding, wintering areas)\n- Some species have discrete distributions while others have overlapping ranges\n- Distribution limits are determined by temperature, salinity, bathymetry, and food availability\n\n### [Geographic Distribution]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Migratory species (salmon) move between coastal and riverine habitats\n- Demersal species (bottom-dwelling) have specific depth distributions\n- Pelagic species distribute widely in open water\n\n**Management implications:**\n\n- Fishing effort should target areas of highest concentration\n- Seasonal closures may protect aggregations during vulnerable periods\n- International boundaries may complicate management of stocks crossing borders\n\n## [Spatial and Temporal Variation in Abundance]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Temporal Variation:**\n\n- **Seasonal changes** - Abundance fluctuates with feeding, spawning, and migration cycles\n- **Interannual variation** - Year-to-year changes in recruitment and survival\n- **Long-term trends** - Decadal-scale changes related to fishing pressure or environmental conditions\n\n## [Spatial and Temporal Variation...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Spatial Variation:**\n\n- **Patchiness** - Fish concentrate in certain areas (spawning grounds, feeding areas)\n- **Gradients** - Density changes across depth, latitude, or habitat types\n- **Hotspots** - Areas of consistently high abundance\n\n## [Spatial and Temporal Variation...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Measurement challenges:**\n\n- Detecting aggregations requires spatially intensive sampling\n- Small-scale variability requires high sampling effort to quantify accurately\n- Temporal dynamics require time series of observations\n\n\n## [Habitat Requirements and Factors Affecting Distribution]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Abiotic Factors:**\n\n- **Temperature** - Most critical factor; thermal preferences vary by species\n- **Salinity** - Freshwater, brackish, or marine preferences\n- **Dissolved oxygen** - Required for respiration; anaerobic zones are avoided\n- **Bathymetry** - Depth preferences related to light and pressure tolerance\n- **Substrate type** - Bottom type affects benthic food availability\n\n## [Habitat Requirements...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Biotic Factors:**\n\n- **Food availability** - Distribution follows food resources\n- **Predation risk** - Avoidance of predator-rich areas\n- **Competition** - Space partitioning with other species\n- **Reproductive habitat** - Essential for spawning and nursery grounds\n\n## [Habitat Requirements...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Habitat Quality:**\n\n- Optimal habitat supports higher population densities\n- Marginal habitat may be temporarily occupied but has lower reproductive success\n- Loss or degradation of critical habitat can limit population size\n\n## [Environmental Influences on Stock Distribution]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Physical Oceanography:**\n\n- Ocean currents transport larvae and affect distribution\n- Upwelling events create productive feeding areas\n- Coastal current patterns structure population distributions\n\n## [Environmental Influences...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Climate and Weather:**\n\n- Climate change shifts suitable habitat ranges\n- Seasonal weather events (storms, cold snaps) cause temporary distribution changes\n- Long-term climate trends alter distribution boundaries\n\n## [Straddling stock and highly migratory fish stock]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- With 1982's United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), coastal nations were given the right to manage fisheries within their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ)\n- But of course, fish don't adhere to imaginary lines in the ocean.\n- The management of two groups -- **straddling and highly migratory fish stocks** became problem after the 1982 Convention.\n\n## [Straddling stock]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Straddling stocks** are fish stocks that migrate across more than one EEZ and the high seas\n- - **Straddling stocks** is the stocks of fish which migrate between, or occur in both, the Exclusive Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ) of one or more states and the high seas\n- Fish stocks that migrate through, or occur in, more than one exclusive economic zone.\n- They include species such as swordfish and marlin.\n\n## [Highly migratory fishes]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Highly migratory fishes** are the ones that travel long distances across international waters\n- These include tuna and tuna-like species, such as marlin, swordfish and sharks.\n\n\n## [Management of Straddling stock and Highly migratory fishes]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- Management of the straddling stock and highly migratory fishes is a shared responsibility between coastal states and the international community.\n- The 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA), an international treaty designed to further implement provisions of the 1982 Convention which;\n\n  - ***Ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks***\n  \n\n## [Management...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- Sovereign responsibility must be worked out in collaboration with neighboring coastal states and fishing entities.\n- Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) are established to manage these stocks collaboratively.\n- **Transboundary stock** range in the EEZs of at least two countries. \n- A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.\n\n# [Examples from Tanzania Marine Waters]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff;

color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **A unit stock** is a population of fish, either of a single or different species, grouped together for assessment purposes which may or may not include all the fish in a stock. \n- A unit stock is a group of fish that:\n\n  - **Share a common gene pool** -- can interbreed\n  - **Occupy a defined geographical area** -- have a specific distribution\n  - **Exhibit similar life history traits** -- growth, reproduction, mortality\n  - **Are subject to similar fishing pressures** -- exploited by the same fisheries\n  - **Are managed as a single entity** -- for conservation and exploitation, -- Can be managed independently from other stocks\n\n## [Determination of a Unit Stock]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- Unit stocks can be determined through various biological and ecological characteristics, including:\n\n  - Distribution patterns -- Where unit stocks are located\n  - Spawning behavior -- Different stocks spawn in different areas\n  - Population parameters -- Recruitment, growth and mortality rates, morphometric differences\n  - Physiological traits -- Temperature at hatching, vertebrae structure, scale decorations, parasite types\n\n\n## [Distribution and Abundance]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n### [Geographic Distribution]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Geographic distribution** refers to the spatial area where a fish stock is found, including the boundaries of its range.\n\n**Key concepts:**\n\n- Fish populations are not uniformly distributed across all suitable habitats\n- Distribution patterns change seasonally (spawning, feeding, wintering areas)\n- Some species have discrete distributions while others have overlapping ranges\n- Distribution limits are determined by temperature, salinity, bathymetry, and food availability\n\n### [Geographic Distribution]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Migratory species (salmon) move between coastal and riverine habitats\n- Demersal species (bottom-dwelling) have specific depth distributions\n- Pelagic species distribute widely in open water\n\n**Management implications:**\n\n- Fishing effort should target areas of highest concentration\n- Seasonal closures may protect aggregations during vulnerable periods\n- International boundaries may complicate management of stocks crossing borders\n\n## [Spatial and Temporal Variation in Abundance]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Temporal Variation:**\n\n- **Seasonal changes** - Abundance fluctuates with feeding, spawning, and migration cycles\n- **Interannual variation** - Year-to-year changes in recruitment and survival\n- **Long-term trends** - Decadal-scale changes related to fishing pressure or environmental conditions\n\n## [Spatial and Temporal Variation...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Spatial Variation:**\n\n- **Patchiness** - Fish concentrate in certain areas (spawning grounds, feeding areas)\n- **Gradients** - Density changes across depth, latitude, or habitat types\n- **Hotspots** - Areas of consistently high abundance\n\n## [Spatial and Temporal Variation...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Measurement challenges:**\n\n- Detecting aggregations requires spatially intensive sampling\n- Small-scale variability requires high sampling effort to quantify accurately\n- Temporal dynamics require time series of observations\n\n\n## [Habitat Requirements and Factors Affecting Distribution]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Abiotic Factors:**\n\n- **Temperature** - Most critical factor; thermal preferences vary by species\n- **Salinity** - Freshwater, brackish, or marine preferences\n- **Dissolved oxygen** - Required for respiration; anaerobic zones are avoided\n- **Bathymetry** - Depth preferences related to light and pressure tolerance\n- **Substrate type** - Bottom type affects benthic food availability\n\n## [Habitat Requirements...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Biotic Factors:**\n\n- **Food availability** - Distribution follows food resources\n- **Predation risk** - Avoidance of predator-rich areas\n- **Competition** - Space partitioning with other species\n- **Reproductive habitat** - Essential for spawning and nursery grounds\n\n## [Habitat Requirements...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Habitat Quality:**\n\n- Optimal habitat supports higher population densities\n- Marginal habitat may be temporarily occupied but has lower reproductive success\n- Loss or degradation of critical habitat can limit population size\n\n## [Environmental Influences on Stock Distribution]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Physical Oceanography:**\n\n- Ocean currents transport larvae and affect distribution\n- Upwelling events create productive feeding areas\n- Coastal current patterns structure population distributions\n\n## [Environmental Influences...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n**Climate and Weather:**\n\n- Climate change shifts suitable habitat ranges\n- Seasonal weather events (storms, cold snaps) cause temporary distribution changes\n- Long-term climate trends alter distribution boundaries\n\n## [Straddling stock and highly migratory fish stock]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- With 1982's United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), coastal nations were given the right to manage fisheries within their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ)\n- But of course, fish don't adhere to imaginary lines in the ocean.\n- The management of two groups -- **straddling and highly migratory fish stocks** became problem after the 1982 Convention.\n\n## [Straddling stock]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Straddling stocks** are fish stocks that migrate across more than one EEZ and the high seas\n- - **Straddling stocks** is the stocks of fish which migrate between, or occur in both, the Exclusive Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ) of one or more states and the high seas\n- Fish stocks that migrate through, or occur in, more than one exclusive economic zone.\n- They include species such as swordfish and marlin.\n\n## [Highly migratory fishes]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- **Highly migratory fishes** are the ones that travel long distances across international waters\n- These include tuna and tuna-like species, such as marlin, swordfish and sharks.\n\n\n## [Management of Straddling stock and Highly migratory fishes]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- Management of the straddling stock and highly migratory fishes is a shared responsibility between coastal states and the international community.\n- The 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA), an international treaty designed to further implement provisions of the 1982 Convention which;\n\n  - ***Ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks***\n  \n\n## [Management...]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff\"}\n\n- Sovereign responsibility must be worked out in collaboration with neighboring coastal states and fishing entities.\n- Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) are established to manage these stocks collaboratively.\n- **Transboundary stock** range in the EEZs of at least two countries. \n- A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.\n\n# [Examples from Tanzania Marine Waters]{style=\"background: #4a1035ff;
