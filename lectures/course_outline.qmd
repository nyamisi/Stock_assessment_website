### Schaefer Surplus Production Model

$$C_t = q \cdot E_t \cdot B_t$$

$$B_{t+1} = B_t + rB_t\left(1 - \frac{B_t}{K}\right) - C_t$$

Where:
- $C_t$ = catch at time t
- $q$ = catchability coefficient
- $E_t$ = fishing effort

### Von Bertalanffy Growth Model

$$L_t = L_\infty(1 - e^{-K(t - t_0)})$$

Where:
- $L_t$ = length at age t
