# SECTION A: Unit Stock (Lecture 5)

## Question 1.1 (Conceptual)

**Define a unit stock and explain the key characteristics that distinguish one unit stock from another.**

### Model Answer:

A **unit stock** is a population of fish (single or multiple species) grouped together for assessment and management purposes that shares a common gene pool and occupies a defined geographical area.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Common gene pool** – Can interbreed and maintain genetic continuity
- **Defined geographic area** – Specific distribution boundaries and habitat
- **Similar life history traits** – Comparable growth, reproduction, and mortality rates
- **Common fishing pressures** – Subject to same fisheries and exploitation patterns
- **Managed as single entity** – Can be independently managed and assessed

**Significance:** Unit stocks allow management of complex multispecies tropical fisheries by dividing populations into manageable units for assessment and conservation.

---

## Question 1.2 (Application)

**You are tasked with determining whether yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean constitute one stock or multiple unit stocks. What methods would you use, and what data would you collect?**

### Model Answer:

**Methods for stock determination:**

1. **Genetic analysis** – DNA markers, microsatellites to assess gene flow and population structure
2. **Morphometric analysis** – Vertebrae counts, scale patterns, size-at-age differences
3. **Parasitology** – Parasite species/intensity indicating isolation
4. **Otolith microchemistry** – Chemical signatures reflecting spawning area origin
5. **Tagging studies** – Track movements and migration patterns

**Data to collect:**
- Tissue samples from throughout Indian Ocean
- Spawning location records (time, area, temperature)
- Growth rates at different locations
- Catch composition and fishing effort data
- Environmental data (temperature, currents, productivity)

**Expected outcomes:** Multiple stocks likely exist (e.g., eastern, western Indian Ocean; seasonal variations)

---

## Question 1.3 (Calculation)

**A lake contains an estimated 50,000 tilapia. A survey found spawning occurring in two separate locations with different substrate types. Genetic analysis shows 85% within-population similarity but only 42% between-population similarity. Should these be managed as one or two unit stocks?**

### Model Answer:

**Analysis:**
- Within-population similarity (85%) indicates relatively homogeneous genetics
- Between-population similarity (42%) suggests significant differentiation and limited gene flow
- Separate spawning locations with different habitats indicate ecological separation

**Recommendation:** Manage as **TWO UNIT STOCKS**

**Rationale:**
- Low between-population genetic similarity (<50%) indicates reproductive isolation
- Separate spawning habitats with different substrates suggest adapted populations
- Independent management prevents mixing strategies and allows location-specific interventions
- May have different growth rates, maturity ages, vulnerability to fishing

## Question 1.4 (Essay)

**Discuss the importance of properly identifying and delineating unit stocks for fisheries management in Tanzania's coastal waters. Include examples of straddling and highly migratory species.**

### Model Answer:

**Importance of unit stock identification:**

1. **Accurate Assessment** – Proper stock delineation ensures abundance estimates reflect actual population boundaries, not artificial divisions

2. **Sustainable Harvesting** – Prevents overfishing by matching catch limits to correct population size. Mixing stocks artificially inflates perceived population

3. **Management Independence** – Allows location-specific regulations (closed seasons, gear restrictions) suited to each stock's dynamics

4. **International Coordination** – Critical for stocks crossing borders (EEZ boundaries)

**Tanzanian Examples:**

**Straddling Species:**
- **Yellowfin tuna** – Exists in both Tanzania's EEZ and high seas; managed by IOTC
- **Swordfish** – Distributed across multiple EEZs; requires transboundary agreements
- **Kingfish** – Moves between Tanzanian and Kenyan waters seasonally

**Highly Migratory Species:**
- **Bigeye tuna** – Oceanic distribution throughout Indian Ocean
- **Albacore** – Annual migrations across thousands of kilometers

**Management Challenges:**
- Must coordinate with IOTC and neighboring countries
- Catch limits set at regional level may not reflect Tanzania's specific fishing pressure
- Stock mixing complicates assessment of Tanzania's impact on global stocks

**Recommendation:** Establish Tanzania-specific monitoring for shared stocks; coordinate assessment data with regional management bodies

# SECTION B: Methods of Stock Abundance Estimation (Lectures 6-7)

## Question 2.1 (Conceptual)

**Distinguish between direct and indirect methods of estimating fish stock abundance. Provide examples of each and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.**

### Model Answer:

**Direct Methods** – Independent abundance estimates not dependent on catch data

*Examples:* Trawl surveys, acoustic surveys, mark-recapture, visual census

**Advantages:**
- Independent of commercial fishery data (unaffected by reporting biases)
- Can provide absolute population estimates
- Give information on spatial distribution

**Disadvantages:**
- High cost and equipment requirements
- Limited temporal coverage
- Species/habitat specific (not universally applicable)
- Logistically demanding

**Indirect Methods** – Use commercial fishery data as index of abundance

*Examples:* CPUE, depletion methods, VPA

**Advantages:**
- Cost-effective (uses existing data)
- Long time series often available
- Large spatial/temporal coverage
- Real-time updates possible

**Disadvantages:**
- Affected by fishing behavior changes
- Technology changes over time bias trends
- Confounded by effort standardization issues
- May not reflect true population dynamics

**Best Practice:** Use combination of methods for cross-validation and uncertainty quantification

---

## Question 2.2 (Comparison Table)

**Complete the following comparison table for methods of estimating fish stock abundance:**

| Method | Data Needs | Cost | Precision | Best For | Key Assumptions |
|--------|-----------|------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Acoustic survey | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| CPUE | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Mark-recapture | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| VPA | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Depletion | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |

### Model Answer:

| Method | Data Needs | Cost | Precision | Best For | Key Assumptions |
|--------|-----------|------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Acoustic | Calibrated echo sounder, fish behavior data | High | Medium-High | Pelagic schooling species | Predictable target strength, minimal scattering |
| CPUE | Catch and effort records | Low | Medium | Commercial stocks with long history | Constant catchability, homogeneous population |
| Mark-recapture | Capture, marking, recapture data | Medium | Medium | Discrete populations | Closed population, equal capture probability |
| VPA | Catch-at-age, natural mortality estimate | Low | Medium-High | Age-structured stocks | Accurate age data, known M |
| Depletion | Sequential catch and effort data | Low | Low-Medium | Closed populations (octopus) | Significant removal (>30%), constant q |

## Question 2.3 (Application)

**A fisheries manager in Zanzibar must choose an abundance estimation method for assessing small pelagic fish (sardines and anchovies). The fishery has:**
- 20 years of commercial catch data
- Limited research budget
- Recent acoustic survey equipment available
- No historical age-structure data

**Which method(s) would you recommend and why?**

### Model Answer:

**Recommended approach: COMBINED METHOD**

**Primary:** Acoustic surveys + CPUE standardization

**Rationale:**

1. **Acoustic surveys (PRIMARY)**
   - Small pelagics form dense schools (ideal for acoustics)
   - Non-lethal monitoring allows repeated surveys
   - Provides spatial distribution information
   - Can estimate size distribution from target strength

2. **CPUE standardization (SECONDARY)**
   - 20-year historical data valuable for trend analysis
   - Can use GLM/GAM to standardize for effort, vessel, season effects
   - Cost-effective complement to surveys
   - Provides long-term context

3. **Why NOT VPA:**
   - Requires accurate age-structure data (not available)
   - Sensitive to terminal F assumptions
   - Better for demersal/single-species stocks

**Implementation Plan:**
- Year 1-2: Conduct seasonal acoustic surveys (3-4 per year) to establish baseline
- Standardize historical CPUE using regression models
- Cross-validate acoustic estimates with CPUE indices
- Establish confidence intervals around abundance estimates
- Use combined estimates for catch recommendations

## Question 2.4 (Calculation - Leslie Depletion Method)

**An octopus population in a coastal cove showed the following catch and effort data over 8 consecutive weeks:**

| Week | Effort (traps) | Days | Catch |
|------|----------------|------|-------|
| 1 | 40 | 5 | 520 |
| 2 | 45 | 5 | 465 |
| 3 | 50 | 5 | 420 |
| 4 | 55 | 5 | 375 |
| 5 | 60 | 5 | 325 |
| 6 | 65 | 5 | 270 |
| 7 | 70 | 5 | 210 |
| 8 | 75 | 5 | 155 |

**Using Leslie Method:**
a) Calculate cumulative catch and CPUE
b) Fit regression of Catch vs. Cumulative Catch
c) Estimate initial population ($N_0$) and catchability (q)

### Model Answer:

**a) Calculate cumulative catch and CPUE:**

| Week | Catch | Cumulative Catch | Total Effort | CPUE |
|------|-------|------------------|--------------|------|
| 1 | 520 | 520 | 200 | 2.60 |
| 2 | 465 | 985 | 225 | 2.07 |
| 3 | 420 | 1405 | 250 | 1.68 |
| 4 | 375 | 1780 | 275 | 1.36 |
| 5 | 325 | 2105 | 300 | 1.08 |
| 6 | 270 | 2375 | 325 | 0.83 |
| 7 | 210 | 2585 | 350 | 0.60 |
| 8 | 155 | 2740 | 375 | 0.41 |

**b) Leslie regression:** $C_t = qN_0 - q \times IC$

Using linear regression on Catch vs. Cumulative Catch:

$$\text{Catch} = 543.6 - 0.187 \times (\text{Cumulative Catch})$$

**c) Estimates:**
- **Intercept ($qN_0$)** = 543.6
- **Slope (−q)** = −0.187, so **q = 0.187**
- **$N_0 = \frac{543.6}{0.187} = 2,905$ octopus**

**Interpretation:** Initial population ≈ 2,905 individuals; 2,740 caught (94% depletion); high catchability indicates octopus are easily captured

---

## Question 2.5 (CPUE Standardization)

**A longline fishery for yellowfin tuna in Tanzanian waters has 10 years of catch data. Raw CPUE (catch/hooks) shows declining trend. However, you notice:**
- Vessel technology improved (GPS, sonar, better refrigeration)
- Fishing season shifted from Jan-June to Mar-August
- Number of vessels increased from 5 to 25

**How would you standardize CPUE to account for these factors? What statistical method would you use?**

### Model Answer:

**Standardization Approach: Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**

**Model specification:**
$$\ln(\text{CPUE}) = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Year} + \beta_2 \text{Season} + \beta_3 \text{Vessel\_Age} + \beta_4 \text{Technology} + \varepsilon$$

**Factors to include:**
1. **Year** – Captures stock abundance trend (primary variable of interest)
2. **Season** – Accounts for seasonal availability/migration (categorical: Jan-Jun vs Mar-Aug)
3. **Vessel size/class** – Standardize effort across different vessel types
4. **Technology level** – Include GPS, sonar availability as binary factors
5. **Fishing ground** – If spatial data available, include location

**Alternative: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)**
- More flexible for non-linear relationships
- Better captures smoothed trends over time
- Allows interaction between factors

**Interpretation:**
- **β₁ (Year coefficient)** = annual change in standardized CPUE
- Negative β₁ = declining stock abundance (accounting for confounding factors)
- Compare to raw CPUE to assess technology/behavior bias

**Expected result:** Standardized CPUE may show less decline (or even slight recovery) compared to raw CPUE, indicating technology improvements masked actual stock status

# SECTION C: Fish Migration & Acoustic Methods

## Question 3.1 (Terminology)

**Define and provide examples for each migration category:**

a) **Diadromous fish** – subcategories: anadromous, catadromous, amphidromous
b) **Potamodromous fish**
c) **Oceanodromous fish**

### Model Answer:

**a) Diadromous** – Migrate between marine and freshwater environments

- **Anadromous** (born in freshwater, spawn in freshwater)
  - *Examples:* Salmon, sea trout, shad
  - Spawn in rivers, juveniles migrate to ocean, adults return to spawn
  - High investment in single spawning event

- **Catadromous** (born in marine, spawn in marine)
  - *Examples:* Freshwater eel, milkfish
  - Spend most life in freshwater, migrate to sea to spawn

- **Amphidromous** (no spawning migration)
  - *Examples:* Mullet, tilapia (some), ten-pounder
  - Larvae spawned in marine environment drift to freshwater
  - Settle and grow in freshwater as juveniles
  - No return migration to spawn

**b) Potamodromous** – Migrate wholly within freshwater

- *Examples:* Trout, bream, coregonids (whitefish), Nile tilapia
- Landlocked species with seasonal migrations
- Migrate for spawning, feeding, or seasonal redistribution
- Often triggered by water level/temperature changes

**c) Oceanodromous** – Migrate wholly within ocean

- *Examples:* Cod, herring, capelin, yellowfin tuna, mackerel
- Long-distance oceanic migrations (thousands of km)
- Spawning grounds separate from feeding grounds
- Highly migratory species (tuna, billfish) may cross ocean basins

**Stock Assessment Implications:**
- Diadromous species require collaborative management between freshwater/marine authorities
- Potamodromous species vulnerable to river barriers and freshwater habitat degradation
- Oceanodromous species require international coordination (regional fisheries bodies like IOTC)

## Question 3.2 (Acoustic Surveys - Theory)

**Explain the principle of acoustic fish detection. Include:**
a) How echo sounders detect fish
b) Why frequency selection matters
c) The concept of target strength

### Model Answer:

**a) Echo sounder principle:**

1. **Signal transmission** – Transducer emits brief sound pulse into water
2. **Reflection** – Sound reflects off objects different in density from water (fish swim bladders)
3. **Echo return** – Reflected sound returns to receiver
4. **Distance calculation** – Time delay × sound speed = distance to object
5. **Amplitude analysis** – Echo strength indicates fish size/density

**b) Frequency selection:**

- **High frequency (>200 kHz)** – Short wavelength, can detect plankton and small fish
- **Lower frequency (<200 kHz)** – Penetrates deeper, detects larger fish, better range
- **Trade-off** – Higher frequency = better resolution but shorter range
- **Species considerations** – Small pelagics use 38-200 kHz; demersal surveys use 10-18 kHz

**Example:**
- Sardine/anchovy surveys: 38-120 kHz (schools near surface, need resolution)
- Demersal surveys: 10-18 kHz (greater depth penetration required)

**c) Target Strength (TS):**

$$TS = 20 \log_{10}(L) + b_{20}$$

- **TS** = Acoustic reflectivity (dB)
- **L** = Fish length (cm)
- **$b_{20}$** = Species-specific constant (typically −70 to −72 dB)

**Interpretation:**
- Larger fish have stronger target strength
- Allows size discrimination from acoustic returns
- Critical for converting acoustic backscatter to abundance estimates

**Example values:**
- Herring (20 cm): TS ≈ -40 dB
- Sardine (12 cm): TS ≈ -50 dB
- Anchovy (10 cm): TS ≈ -55 dB

## Question 3.3 (Acoustic Survey Design)

**Design an acoustic survey for assessing small pelagic fish stocks off the coast of Dar es Salaam. Include:**
a) Survey design and spatial coverage
b) Equipment specifications
c) Data collection protocol
d) Validation methods

### Model Answer:

**a) Survey Design:**

**Study Area:**
- Depth range: 0-200 m (continental shelf)
- Area: 50 km × 100 km = 5,000 km²
- Transect design: Parallel lines perpendicular to coast, 5 km spacing

**Transects:**
- 20 transects, each 100 km long
- Vessel speed: 10 knots (constant)
- 3 survey lines at different times (replicate)
- Seasonal design: 4 surveys per year (quarterly)

**b) Equipment:**

- **Echo sounder:** Split-beam, calibrated quarterly
- **Frequency:** 38 kHz or 120 kHz (for small pelagics)
- **Transducer:** Mounted 1-2 m below hull
- **Data logging:** Simultaneous GPS, depth, temperature, echo integration

**c) Data Collection Protocol:**

1. **Pre-survey:** Calibrate echo sounder using copper sphere
2. **Transect:** Log acoustic data continuously; record every 100 m
3. **Sampling:** Collect biological samples (length, age, species ID) at strategic locations using trawls or nets
4. **Environmental:** Record SST, salinity, turbidity, oxygen
5. **Post-survey:** Verify data quality, conduct backup calibration

**d) Validation:**

1. **Biological sampling** – Conduct midwater trawls to confirm acoustic detections match captured species
2. **Visual observation** – Verify surface schools observed match acoustic targets
3. **Cross-validation** – Compare acoustic estimates with:
   - Commercial CPUE data from same period
   - Previous year acoustic surveys
   - Larval/egg surveys (if available)
4. **Uncertainty estimation** – Bootstrap or Bayesian methods to estimate confidence intervals around abundance

**Expected Output:**
- Biomass estimate (tonnes) with 95% CI
- Spatial distribution map
- Size-frequency distribution
- Recruitment indices (juvenile abundance)

# SECTION D: Length-Weight Relationships (LWR)

## Question 4.1 (Conceptual)

**Define the length-weight relationship (LWR). Explain:**
a) The biological meaning of the equation $W = aL^b$
b) What isometric growth means
c) Why LWR is important in fisheries management

### Model Answer:

**a) LWR equation: $W = aL^b$**

- **W** = Weight (g or kg)
- **L** = Length (cm or mm)
- **a** = Condition coefficient (species and environment specific)
- **b** = Growth exponent (allometric coefficient)

**Biological interpretation:**
- Describes how weight scales with length across population
- $b = 3$ predicts isometric growth (weight increases with L³)
- $b ≠ 3$ indicates allometric growth (disproportionate weight-to-length ratio)
- Typically fits power-law relationship due to 3D body structure

**b) Isometric growth ($b = 3$):**

- Fish maintains constant body shape and density as it grows
- Weight ∝ Length³ (volume relationship)
- Example: Red snapper with b = 3.02

**Allometric growth ($b ≠ 3$):**
- **b > 3**: Fish becomes proportionally heavier with growth ("deepening body")
- **b < 3**: Fish becomes proportionally lighter with growth ("thinning body")
- May reflect seasonal changes, sexual maturity, environmental conditions

**c) Importance in fisheries management:**

1. **Condition monitoring** – Deviation from species-specific LWR indicates health/nutrition
2. **Stock assessment** – Convert length data to biomass estimates
3. **Population dynamics** – Combine with age-length keys for cohort analysis
4. **Size regulations** – Establish minimum/maximum size limits based on weight-length trade-offs
5. **Market standards** – Determine fish value/quality
6. **Climate impacts** – Changes in slope/intercept may reflect environmental stress

---

## Question 4.2 (Calculation)

**Red snapper length-weight data collected from Tanzanian coastal waters show:**
- Sample size: 80 fish
- Length range: 10-55 cm
- Power-law regression: $\ln(W) = -2.45 + 3.02 \times \ln(L)$ (R² = 0.94)

**Calculate:**
a) Parameter *a* and *b*
b) Expected weight at L = 30 cm and L = 50 cm
c) Condition factor K at each length
d) Assess growth pattern (isometric or allometric)

### Model Answer:

**a) Extract parameters from regression:**

From $\ln(W) = -2.45 + 3.02 \times \ln(L)$:

- $\ln(a) = -2.45$, therefore **a = e^{-2.45} = 0.086**
- **b = 3.02**

**Equation: $W = 0.086 \times L^{3.02}$**

**b) Predicted weights:**

At L = 30 cm:
$$W = 0.086 \times 30^{3.02} = 0.086 \times 24,411 = 2,099 \text{ g} = 2.1 \text{ kg}$$

At L = 50 cm:
$$W = 0.086 \times 50^{3.02} = 0.086 \times 125,893 = 10,827 \text{ g} = 10.8 \text{ kg}$$

**c) Condition factor K:**

Standard form: $K = 100,000 \times \frac{W}{L^3}$ (or $K = 10 \times \frac{W}{L^3}$ in relative form)

For L = 30 cm, W = 2.1 kg:
$$K = \frac{1.0 \times 2100}{30^3} = \frac{2100}{27,000} = 0.078$$

For L = 50 cm, W = 10.8 kg:
$$K = \frac{1.0 \times 10,800}{50^3} = \frac{10,800}{125,000} = 0.086$$

**d) Growth pattern assessment:**

- **b = 3.02 ≈ 3** → **ISOMETRIC GROWTH**
- Fish maintains constant shape and density across size range
- Weight increases proportionally to volume (L³)
- Growth is homogeneous (no allometric deviation)
- R² = 0.94 indicates excellent fit (94% of variation explained)

**Biological interpretation:** Red snapper shows uniform growth pattern; body proportions remain consistent from juvenile to adult

---

## Question 4.3 (Application - Fisheries Management)

**Compare two fish populations based on their LWR:**

**Population A (Lake Victoria Tilapia):**
- $W = 0.018 \times L^{2.85}$

**Population B (Lake Tanganyika Cichlid):**
- $W = 0.025 \times L^{3.15}$

**For fish of 25 cm length, calculate:**
a) Expected weights
b) Condition factors
c) Which population has better condition? Explain biological implications.

### Model Answer:

**a) Expected weights at L = 25 cm:**

**Population A:**
$$W_A = 0.018 \times 25^{2.85} = 0.018 \times 3,570 = 64.3 \text{ g}$$

**Population B:**
$$W_B = 0.025 \times 25^{3.15} = 0.025 \times 9,441 = 236 \text{ g}$$

**b) Condition factors:**

**Population A:** $K_A = \frac{64.3}{25^3} = 0.041$ (below standard isometric of 0.05)

**Population B:** $K_B = \frac{236}{25^3} = 0.151$ (above standard)

**c) Comparison and interpretation:**

| Metric | Population A | Population B | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| b value | 2.85 | 3.15 | B has allometric growth (heavier) |
| Condition K | 0.041 | 0.151 | B in better nutritional condition |
| Growth pattern | Negative allometry | Positive allometry | A losing weight proportionally; B gaining |

**Biological Implications:**

**Population A (Lake Victoria):**
- **Negative allometry** (b < 3) indicates fish becoming "thinned" with growth
- **Possible causes:** 
  - Nutritional stress or food scarcity
  - High fishing pressure on larger individuals
  - Environmental degradation
- **Management concern:** Declining condition may reduce fecundity and survival

**Population B (Lake Tanganyika):**
- **Positive allometry** (b > 3) indicates fish "deepening" with growth
- **Likely healthier:** Better nutrition, adequate food resources
- **Positive sign:** May reflect refuge status or lower fishing pressure
- Population appears more robust for sustainable harvest

**Management Recommendations:**
- **Pop. A:** Investigate food availability; consider harvest restrictions or habitat restoration
- **Pop. B:** Can likely sustain higher fishing pressure; monitor for changes in condition

## Question 4.4 (Statistical Analysis)

**You collected LWR data on 100 sardines. Propose:**
a) Statistical methods to fit LWR
b) How to test for isometry (b = 3)
c) Uncertainty quantification approach

### Model Answer:

**a) Statistical fitting methods:**

**Method 1: Log-linear regression (Most Common)**
- Transform: $\ln(W) = \ln(a) + b \times \ln(L)$
- Fit OLS regression on log-transformed data
- Advantages: Linear model, easy interpretation
- Disadvantages: Assumes log-normal error structure

**Method 2: Power-law regression (Direct)**
- Fit $W = aL^b$ directly using non-linear regression
- Advantages: Models original scale; avoids log-transformation bias
- Disadvantages: Requires iterative algorithms (R: `nls()`, `nlme()`)

**Method 3: Bayesian approach**
- Specify prior distributions for a and b
- Update with likelihood from data
- Advantages: Incorporate prior knowledge; full posterior uncertainty
- Disadvantages: More computationally intensive

**b) Test for isometry (H₀: b = 3):**

**Approach 1: Confidence interval**
- Fit regression, extract 95% CI for b coefficient
- If CI contains 3 → isometric (fail to reject H₀)
- If CI excludes 3 → allometric (reject H₀)

**Approach 2: t-test**
$$t = \frac{b - 3}{SE_b}$$
where $SE_b$ = standard error of b coefficient

- If |t| > critical value → significantly different from 3
- Disadvantage: Low statistical power with this design

**Approach 3: Constraint regression**
- Fit both models: (1) unconstrained; (2) constrained to b = 3
- Use likelihood ratio test to compare models
- More powerful than simple t-test

**c) Uncertainty quantification:**

**Method 1: Confidence intervals**
- Extract 95% CI for parameters a, b from regression output
- Propagate to predicted weight: 95% CI on weight at each length

**Method 2: Prediction intervals**
- Wider than confidence intervals (include prediction error)
- Represents range for individual fish predictions

**Method 3: Bootstrap**
- Resample 100 sardines (with replacement) 1000 times
- Fit LWR to each resample
- Calculate percentile CI for a and b from bootstrap distribution

**Method 4: Bayesian posterior samples**
- Generate posterior samples of (a, b)
- Compute credible intervals (typically 95%)
- More intuitive interpretation: P(b = 3 | data)

**Recommended approach:** Log-linear regression with bootstrap CI on parameters

# SECTION E: Integrated Assessment

## Question 5.1 (Synthesis - All Topics)

**You are assigned to conduct a stock assessment for yellowfin tuna in Tanzanian EEZ. The stock is:**
- Highly migratory (oceanodromous)
- Managed by IOTC (Indian Ocean Tuna Commission)
- Recently showing declining CPUE trends
- Subject to both artisanal and industrial fishing

**Develop a comprehensive assessment plan including:**
a) Unit stock definition and boundaries
b) Methods for abundance estimation (justify selection)
c) Data requirements
d) Management recommendations

### Model Answer:

**a) Unit stock definition:**

**Indian Ocean Yellowfin Tuna (Thunnus albacares):**

- **Geographic scope:** Entire Indian Ocean (Tanzania's EEZ is part of larger stock)
- **Distribution:** Pelagic, oceanodromous; seasonal distribution patterns
- **Genetic unity:** Single panmictic population throughout Indian Ocean
- **Management boundary:** IOTC statistical areas (5°S-20°E to 25°S-90°E)
- **Spawning areas:** Multiple locations; seasonal convergence off Somalia, Mozambique

**Implication for Tanzania:** Cannot manage independently; requires IOTC coordination

**b) Abundance estimation methods (Combined approach):**

**Primary Methods:**
1. **Acoustic surveys** (2 per year, 2-week duration each)
   - Target surface schools off Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar
   - 38 kHz frequency (pelagic small-fish optimized)
   - Covers shelf and slope regions

2. **CPUE standardization** (commercial longline data)
   - 20 years available data from industrial fleet
   - Standardize for vessel type, technology, season, area
   - Use GLM with year effect as abundance index

3. **Mark-recapture** (tagging program, ongoing)
   - Tag ~2,000 juvenile yellowfin annually
   - Provides movement, survival, migration data
   - Complements acoustic/CPUE estimates

**Secondary Methods:**
4. **Egg/larval surveys** (seasonal, if budget allows)
   - DEPM during peak spawning (Sept-Nov)
   - Estimates spawning stock biomass independent of catch

**c) Data requirements:**

| Data Type | Source | Frequency | Priority |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Acoustic backscatter | Research vessel surveys | Quarterly | High |
| Commercial catch | Landing records | Daily | High |
| Fishing effort | Logbooks (GPS tracks) | Daily | High |
| Biological (length, age) | Observer program | Continuous | High |
| Environmental (SST, currents) | NOAA/Sentinel | Daily | Medium |
| Tagging data | Research program | Annual | Medium |
| Spawning indicators | Gonad analysis | Quarterly | Medium |

**d) Management recommendations:**

**Short-term (0-2 years):**
- **Current status assessment:** Combine all methods for baseline estimate
- **Catch limit:** Set at 80-90% of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) pending full assessment
- **Data collection:** Intensify observer coverage (target 20% of boats monitored)
- **Regional coordination:** Submit Tanzania data to IOTC working group

**Medium-term (2-5 years):**
- **Stock modeling:** Develop integrated population model combining all data sources
- **Quota allocation:** If stock shared, negotiate Tanzania's share with IOTC
- **Sustainability:** Implement seasonal closures during peak spawning if assessment indicates stress
- **Economic efficiency:** License fewer high-tech vessels if CPUE standardization shows technology bias

**Long-term (5+ years):**
- **Ecosystem monitoring:** Track small pelagics (food base), larger predators (tuna competitors)
- **Climate adaptation:** Monitor oceanographic changes (upwelling intensity, distribution shifts)
- **Alternative livelihoods:** Develop contingency plans if stock declines necessitate fleet reduction

## Question 5.2 (Research Design)

**Design a research project to investigate the relationship between ocean productivity (Chl-a from MODIS satellite data) and fish catch in Zanzibar coastal waters. Include:**

a) Hypothesis and specific objectives
b) Sampling design (spatial, temporal)
c) Data collection protocol
d) Statistical analysis approach

### Model Answer:

**a) Hypothesis and objectives:**

**General Hypothesis:** Ocean productivity (chlorophyll-a concentration) is positively related to fish catch in Zanzibar coastal waters, with variable lag between productivity changes and catch response.

**Specific Objectives:**
1. Quantify spatial-temporal patterns of Chl-a in Zanzibar EEZ
2. Characterize monthly variation in fish catch across coastal zones
3. Determine correlation between Chl-a and catch (synchronous and lagged)
4. Identify seasonal drivers of productivity-catch relationship

**b) Sampling design:**

**Spatial:**
- Divide Zanzibar coastal zone into 5 grid cells (5°S-7°S; 39°E-42°E)
- 1 km² resolution for satellite data; aggregate to 10 km for analysis
- Focus on shelf waters (0-200 m depth)

**Temporal:**
- Time period: 2015-2025 (10 years complete data coverage)
- Satellite data: Monthly MODIS Aqua Chl-a (4 km resolution)
- Catch data: Monthly landing records from fish markets (3 major ports)
- Frequency: Monthly aggregations for analysis; seasonal analysis secondary

**c) Data collection protocol:**

**Satellite data (MODIS Aqua):**
- Download monthly L3 standard mapped images from NASA Earthdata
- Extract Chl-a values (mg/m³) for 5 grid cells
- Quality control: Remove cloud-covered pixels, interpolate if <20% missing
- Calculate zonal means and standard deviation

**Catch data:**
- Survey landing sites: Dar es Salaam (main port), Zanzibar City, Bagamoyo
- Record: Date, fish species, weight landed, vessel type, fishing area
- Aggregate by month and grid cell using GPS coordinates if available
- Cross-check against Ministry fisheries records

**Environmental covariates:**
- Sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS
- Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
- Wind speed (from NOAA reanalysis)

**d) Statistical analysis:**

**Step 1: Descriptive analysis**
- Time series plots of Chl-a and catch (overall and by grid cell)
- Seasonal decomposition (trend + seasonal + residual components)
- Calculate mean, SD, CV for each month/grid cell

**Step 2: Correlation analysis**

**Synchronous (same month):**
$$\text{Catch}_t \sim \text{Chl-a}_t$$

**Lagged (productivity leads catch):**
$$\text{Catch}_t \sim \text{Chl-a}_{t-1}, \text{Chl-a}_{t-2}, \text{Chl-a}_{t-3}$$

- Calculate Pearson/Spearman correlations
- Test for significance (α = 0.05)
- Identify optimal lag period

**Step 3: Regression modeling**

**Model structure (Poisson GLM or linear regression):**
$$\ln(\text{Catch}_t) = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Chl-a}_{t-\tau} + \beta_2 \text{SST}_t + \beta_3 \text{Season}_t + \varepsilon_t$$

where τ = optimal lag identified in correlation analysis

**Predictors:**
- Chl-a at optimal lag
- SST (thermal preference)
- Seasonal dummy variables (Jan-March, etc.)
- Interannual trends

**Model diagnostics:**
- Check residual normality, homoscedasticity
- Test for temporal autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson)
- Assess multicollinearity (VIF < 5)
- Cross-validation: Split data 80/20, assess prediction error

**Step 4: Spatial analysis**

**Repeat regression by grid cell** to identify geographic variation in productivity-catch relationship

**Expected outcomes:**
- Significant positive Chl-a-catch correlation (lag 0-2 months expected)
- Stronger relationship during upwelling season
- Spatial heterogeneity in lag periods

**Deliverables:**
- Spatio-temporal maps of Chl-a and catch
- Correlation/regression summary table
- Predictive model for catch forecasting based on current Chl-a
- Management recommendations for seasonal fishing timing

## [Discussion Questions]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

1. Why does the length-weight relationship follow a cubic pattern (b ≈ 3)?

2. How would you explain the difference between isometric and allometric growth to fishery managers?

3. Why is it important to update length-weight relationships periodically?

4. How would changes in fish condition (well-fed vs. starving) affect the 'a' parameter?

5. What would be the implications of using wrong L-W parameters in a stock assessment?
