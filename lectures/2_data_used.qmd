## [Data used in stock assessments]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"} 

- Data for fish stock assessments falls into two main categories:

1. Fishery-dependent data
1. Fishery-independent data
  

## [Fishery-Dependent Data]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"} 

**Overview**

Fishery-dependent data comes directly from the fishing process itself. Common sources include:

- Self-reporting by fishers
- Onboard observers accompanying fishing vessels
- Portside surveys and sampling
- Telephone surveys
- Vessel-monitoring systems

## [Fishery-Independent Data]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Overview**

Fishery-independent data comes from research activities that do not involve harvesting fish. These include:

- Research surveys using standardized gear (trawls, seines, acoustic, video, and side-scan sonar)
- Tagging experiments
- Acoustic surveys to detect fish abundance using specialized detectors 

## [Data Requirements for Stock Assessments]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

Successful stock assessments require three key types of data:

1. **Catch data** – information on harvested fish
1. **Relative abundance data** – indices of stock size
1. **Life history data** – species's age, growth, and maturity information

Both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data sources contribute to meeting these requirements.

# [Fishery-Dependent Data]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

## [Landing Records]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

Landing records are among the most common fishery-dependent data sources:

- Records result directly from the sale of caught fish at ports
- Typically provide information on **landed catch only**
- Usually recorded as **total weight** rather than number of individual fish
- Often supplemented by port samples for biological information

## [Portside Sampling]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Definition and purpose**

Portside sampling involves collecting biological data from a portion of the catch at landing sites:

- Conducted by government scientists called **portside observers** or **port agents**
- Samples are measured for **size** and **age** information
- For recreational fisheries, this is referred to as a **creel survey**

**Data collection methods**

- Fish size is measured directly at the dock
- Age is determined by counting growth rings in fish scales or otoliths (ear bones), similar to counting tree rings 



## [Onboard Observers]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Purpose**

Onboard observers are government personnel who accompany commercial fishing vessels to:

- Monitor how fishermen interact with target and non-target species
- Collect detailed information about catch composition

**Data collected**

- Sample catch for **size** and **age** information
- Estimate **bycatch** (incidental catches of non-target species)
- Estimate **discards** (fish returned to the sea) 


## [Log Books and Vessel Trip Reports]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Overview**

Fishermen may be required or encouraged to keep their own records:

- **Log books** and **vessel trip reports** document fishing activities
- Maintained either as mandatory requirement or organized voluntary effort

**Reliability and applications**

- Less reliable than landing records and onboard observer data for estimating catch weight and numbers
- Valuable for determining **spatial distribution** of fishing effort
- Useful for tracking **fishing effort** across seasons and areas
- Some fisheries use **vessel monitoring systems (VMS)** – electronic devices that automatically record vessel location and movements 

## [Telephone Surveys]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- **Primary method** for collecting data on recreational fisheries
- Also widely used for **small-scale fisheries** to record catch numbers, location, and size information
- Provides complementary data when on-site sampling is impractical



# [Fishery-Independent Data]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

## [Research Survey Approaches]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- Research surveys provide data independent of fishing activities
- Scientists use **standardized sampling gear**: trawls, seines, hydroacoustics, and video
- Samples are collected throughout the potential range of target fish

**Survey Flexibility**

- Can target multiple species or focus on a single species
- Can target specific life stages (e.g., juvenile year classes)

**Data Benefits**

- Provide abundance indices for stock assessment
- Collect size, age, and maturity information from the stock


## [Mark and Recapture Studies]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- A specialized research method for estimating population parameters
- Provides estimates of:
  - Fish movement and migration patterns
  - Growth rates
  - Natural mortality
  - Discard mortality



## [Fisheries Frame Survey]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Definition**

- A census-based approach that collects data on all fishing vessels and gear types
- Covers all homeports and fishing sites within the assessment area

**Supplementary Information**

- Fishing trip patterns and frequency
- Seasonal patterns of gear use
- Socio-economic information about fishing communities
- Demographic profiles of fishers


## [Frame Survey Data Collection]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Landing Site and Fleet Information**

- Number of operational fish landing sites
- Number of active fishers
- Number and types of fishing crafts
- Modes of propulsion (motorized, manual)

**Facilities and Services**

- Infrastructure available at landing sites
- Services provided by fisheries staff
- Support from Beach Management Units (BMUs)


## [Frame Survey Data Collection (continued)]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}


**Gear Information**

- Types and sizes of fishing gears in use
- Operation modes for different gear types

**Management Applications**

- Recommendations for fishery development and management
- **Raising factors** for extrapolating Catch Assessment Survey (CAS) data to total catch estimates


## [Frame Survey Implementation]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}


**Staffing Requirements**

- Often requires many data collectors
- May employ temporary staff to supplement regular fisheries personnel

**Training and Instructions**

- Data collectors must receive precise, unambiguous instructions
- Critical for ensuring data reliability
- Detailed training on recording forms and their proper use
- Clear explanation of each form's purpose within the overall programme


## [Frame Survey Planning and Quality Assurance]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}


**Survey Design**

- Clarify categories for boat and gear types
- Define sequential vs. concurrent gear use
- Identify whether new gear types should be included

**Field Operations**

- Plan visits to all landing ports
- Develop protocols for approaching and interviewing fishers and village leaders
- Ensure comprehensive information on vessel and gear numbers

**Quality Control**

- Implement cross-checking procedures for collected data
- Establish protocols for addressing serious discrepancies



## [Limitations of Frame Surveys]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Temporal Snapshot**

- Provide **static information** valid only at the time of the survey
- Represent a single **snapshot** of the fishery

**Impact of Changes**

- Rapid changes to the fishery compromise accuracy:
  - Changes in number of fishing boats
  - Introduction of new fishing gear types
  - Shifts in fishing effort or patterns
- Such changes make raising factors unreliable for estimating total effort


## [Data Integration in Fish Stock Assessment]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Key Data Components**

1. **Fisheries Statistics** – catch and effort data
1. **Frame Survey Data** – fleet and gear information
1. **Biological Data** – from research surveys and port sampling

**Application**

- These data are integrated to develop predictive models
- Models assess current stock status under various conditions
- Enable managers to evaluate impacts of different management strategies



# [Catch Assessment Surveys (CAS)]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

## [Catch Assessment Surveys]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**What is a CAS?**

- Survey designed to estimate **total catch** from a fishery
- Based on sampling a portion of landing sites or fishing effort

**Why CAS Matters**

- Bridges gap between complete census (infeasible) and incomplete data
- Provides reliable catch estimates with quantified uncertainty
- Essential for ecosystem-based management
- Supports accurate monitoring of harvest levels

## [CAS vs. Frame Surveys]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Frame Survey**

- Census of all fishing vessels and gear
- Provides information on fishing infrastructure and capacity

**Catch Assessment Survey**

- Sampling of catch from selected landing sites or vessels
- Collects biological and quantitative catch data
- Uses frame survey raising factors to estimate total catch

**Integration**

- Frame survey defines population and provides raising factors
- CAS provides representative sample of actual catches
- Together produce robust total catch estimates
- Uses **raising factors** from frame surveys to scale up sample data to population level
- Generates **raising factors** for expansion to total population


## [CAS Data Collection]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Information Recorded**

- **Total catch weight** by species and gear type
- **Length and age composition** of catch
- **Sex and maturity information** from samples
- **Bycatch and discards** estimates
- **Date, location, and gear type** for each sample

## [CAS Data Collection...]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Raising Factor Calculation**

Raising Factor = Total boats/gear from frame survey ÷ Sampled boats/gear

**Example**

- Frame survey identifies 100 fishing boats at a landing site
- CAS samples 20 boats' catch
- Raising factor = 100 ÷ 20 = 5
- Sample catch × 5 = Estimate of total catch from all boats
