## [Introduction]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- Fish stock assessment was developed in the temperate regions where there are very few species of fish.
- It was based on a single species
- However, such a consideration is not very applicable for tropical fisheries where we have multi-species fisheries because;

  + Different species are mixed up
  + There is very high interaction among species

- Fish populations are divided into **stocks** for management and assessment purposes
- Understanding the distribution, abundance, and methods for estimating these parameters is critical for effective stock assessment and sustainable fisheries management.

## [Unit Stock]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- **A unit stock** is a population of fish, either of a single or different species, grouped together for assessment purposes which may or may not include all the fish in a stock. 
- A unit stock is a group of fish that:

  - **Share a common gene pool** -- can interbreed
  - **Occupy a defined geographical area** -- have a specific distribution
  - **Exhibit similar life history traits** -- growth, reproduction, mortality
  - **Are subject to similar fishing pressures** -- exploited by the same fisheries
  - **Are managed as a single entity** -- for conservation and exploitation, -- Can be managed independently from other stocks

## [Determination of a Unit Stock]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- Unit stocks can be determined through various biological and ecological characteristics, including:

  - Distribution patterns -- Where unit stocks are located
  - Spawning behavior -- Different stocks spawn in different areas
  - Population parameters -- Recruitment, growth and mortality rates, morphometric differences
  - Physiological traits -- Temperature at hatching, vertebrae structure, scale decorations, parasite types


## [Distribution and Abundance]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

### [Geographic Distribution]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- **Geographic distribution** refers to the spatial area where a fish stock is found, including the boundaries of its range.

**Key concepts:**

- Fish populations are not uniformly distributed across all suitable habitats
- Distribution patterns change seasonally (spawning, feeding, wintering areas)
- Some species have discrete distributions while others have overlapping ranges
- Distribution limits are determined by temperature, salinity, bathymetry, and food availability

### [Geographic Distribution]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Examples:**

- Migratory species (salmon) move between coastal and riverine habitats
- Demersal species (bottom-dwelling) have specific depth distributions
- Pelagic species distribute widely in open water

**Management implications:**

- Fishing effort should target areas of highest concentration
- Seasonal closures may protect aggregations during vulnerable periods
- International boundaries may complicate management of stocks crossing borders

## [Spatial and Temporal Variation in Abundance]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Temporal Variation:**

- **Seasonal changes** - Abundance fluctuates with feeding, spawning, and migration cycles
- **Interannual variation** - Year-to-year changes in recruitment and survival
- **Long-term trends** - Decadal-scale changes related to fishing pressure or environmental conditions

## [Spatial and Temporal Variation...]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Spatial Variation:**

- **Patchiness** - Fish concentrate in certain areas (spawning grounds, feeding areas)
- **Gradients** - Density changes across depth, latitude, or habitat types
- **Hotspots** - Areas of consistently high abundance

## [Spatial and Temporal Variation...]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Measurement challenges:**

- Detecting aggregations requires spatially intensive sampling
- Small-scale variability requires high sampling effort to quantify accurately
- Temporal dynamics require time series of observations


## [Habitat Requirements and Factors Affecting Distribution]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Abiotic Factors:**

- **Temperature** - Most critical factor; thermal preferences vary by species
- **Salinity** - Freshwater, brackish, or marine preferences
- **Dissolved oxygen** - Required for respiration; anaerobic zones are avoided
- **Bathymetry** - Depth preferences related to light and pressure tolerance
- **Substrate type** - Bottom type affects benthic food availability

## [Habitat Requirements...]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Biotic Factors:**

- **Food availability** - Distribution follows food resources
- **Predation risk** - Avoidance of predator-rich areas
- **Competition** - Space partitioning with other species
- **Reproductive habitat** - Essential for spawning and nursery grounds

## [Habitat Requirements...]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Habitat Quality:**

- Optimal habitat supports higher population densities
- Marginal habitat may be temporarily occupied but has lower reproductive success
- Loss or degradation of critical habitat can limit population size

## [Environmental Influences on Stock Distribution]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Physical Oceanography:**

- Ocean currents transport larvae and affect distribution
- Upwelling events create productive feeding areas
- Coastal current patterns structure population distributions

## [Environmental Influences...]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

**Climate and Weather:**

- Climate change shifts suitable habitat ranges
- Seasonal weather events (storms, cold snaps) cause temporary distribution changes
- Long-term climate trends alter distribution boundaries

## [Straddling stock and highly migratory fish stock]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- With 1982's United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), coastal nations were given the right to manage fisheries within their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ)
- But of course, fish don't adhere to imaginary lines in the ocean.
- The management of two groups -- **straddling and highly migratory fish stocks** became problem after the 1982 Convention.

## [Straddling stock]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- **Straddling stocks** are fish stocks that migrate across more than one EEZ and the high seas
- - **Straddling stocks** is the stocks of fish which migrate between, or occur in both, the Exclusive Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ) of one or more states and the high seas
- Fish stocks that migrate through, or occur in, more than one exclusive economic zone.
- They include species such as swordfish and marlin.

## [Highly migratory fishes]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- **Highly migratory fishes** are the ones that travel long distances across international waters
- These include tuna and tuna-like species, such as marlin, swordfish and sharks.


## [Management of Straddling stock and Highly migratory fishes]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- Management of the straddling stock and highly migratory fishes is a shared responsibility between coastal states and the international community.
- The 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA), an international treaty designed to further implement provisions of the 1982 Convention which;

  - ***Ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks***
  

## [Management...]{style="background: #4a1035ff; color: #bebe56ff"}

- Sovereign responsibility must be worked out in collaboration with neighboring coastal states and fishing entities.
- Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) are established to manage these stocks collaboratively.
- **Transboundary stock** range in the EEZs of at least two countries. 
- A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.

## Mixed stock 


- **A mixed stock fishery** is a fishery stock of variety ages, sizes, species, geographic or genetic origins or any combination of these variables. 

- It has some challenges in management due to difficulties in targeting a specific fish type using a certain fishing methods. 

- Mixed stock of a species has significant differences in morphological and biological characteristics. 

- The mixed stock population may unite into a unit stock by gene flow.


## Mixed stock... 

- The morphometric characters and meristic characters are to be taken for different stocks/populations of a species. 

- The population are to be segregated using PCA statistical test

- Mixed stock of a species is common in tropical waters. 

- Assessment of such tropical stocks becomes difficult by using conventional models. 




## Mixed stock... 

- Refinements are needed for proper assessment. 

- The aging becomes difficult in a mixed stock of tropical species.

- Usually many cohorts are released from a tropical stock; hence the assessment becomes a problem on tropical stocks of a mixed species. 

- Mixed stock of a species has varied spawning seasons and the calculation of length at first maturity and growth gets varied

## Limitations in the assessment of tropical fish stocks

- For calculation of stock assessment of mixed stock of a species, the conventional models framed for temperate species should be used in caution. 

-  The mortality parameters such as F and M, fishing effort and growth parameters are to be calculated separately

- Because these parameters form input data for estimation of stock in conventional models.




## Part 2: Methods of Estimating Fish Stock Abundance

### 2.1 Direct Methods (Surveys and Sampling)

**Trawl Surveys:**
- Bottom or mid-water trawling in systematic grid pattern
- Standardized vessels, gear, and protocols ensure comparability
- Provides age/size composition data
- Index of relative abundance (CPUE)
- **Advantages:** Direct observation, compositional data
- **Disadvantages:** Gear selectivity, avoidance behavior, high cost

**Dredges and Dip Nets:**
- For benthic and demersal species
- Smaller spatial coverage than trawls
- High observation effort per area

**Seining and Gillnetting:**
- Specialized methods for coastal and nearshore areas
- Often used in smaller-scale fisheries

---

### 2.2 Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) Indices

**Definition:** CPUE is the catch obtained per standardized unit of fishing effort.

**Formula:**
$$\text{CPUE} = \frac{\text{Total Catch}}{\text{Total Effort}}$$

Where effort could be:
- Fishing hours
- Days at sea
- Number of hooks (for longline)
- Distance trawled
- Number of traps

**Standardization:**
- Raw CPUE must be standardized for differences in:
  - Vessel characteristics (size, power, technology)
  - Seasonal effects
  - Geographic area
  - Environmental variables
- Generalized Linear Models (GLM) or other statistical methods used

**Advantages:**
- Uses existing commercial fishing data
- Cost-effective
- Long time series available
- Real-time updates possible

**Disadvantages:**
- Affected by fisher behavior (targeting, avoidance)
- Changes in technology affect catchability
- Assumes effort is independent

---

### 2.3 Mark-Recapture and Tagging Studies

**Basic Principle:**
1. Capture, mark, and release a known number of fish (N₁)
2. Recapture a sample (n₂)
3. Count marked individuals in recapture (m)
4. Estimate population size using Lincoln-Petersen formula:

$$\hat{N} = \frac{N_1 \times n_2}{m}$$

**Modified Approaches:**
- Multiple recapture events (Schnabel method)
- Robust design (closed sessions within open population)
- Bayesian approaches for uncertainty quantification

**Advantages:**
- Direct abundance estimate for specific area
- Provides movement and survival information
- Useful for smaller populations

**Disadvantages:**
- Tagging causes stress and mortality
- Tag loss reduces accuracy
- Expensive and labor-intensive
- Limited to feasible population sizes

---

### 2.4 Acoustic Surveys

**Principle:**
- Sound waves detect fish schools through differences in density
- Returns are converted to fish density estimates
- High spatial resolution (meters)

**Technology:**
- Single-beam and split-beam echosounders
- Multibeam systems for 3D mapping
- Autonomous underwater vehicles for remote surveys

**Target Strength:**
- Measured in dB (decibels)
- Relates to fish size and species
- Must be calibrated for reliable estimates

**Advantages:**
- Rapid spatial coverage
- Non-lethal
- Good for pelagic fish schools
- Can estimate fish size distribution

**Disadvantages:**
- Species identification challenging
- Shallow water complications (near-field effects)
- Environmental noise affects detection
- Expensive equipment

### 2.5 Visual Surveys and Underwater Observation

**Snorkeling and Diving:**
- Direct observation of fish density
- Limited to clear water and shallow depths
- Good for reef or estuarine species
- High survey cost per area

**Underwater Video:**
- Remote operated vehicles (ROVs) for deeper water
- Fixed cameras at monitoring stations
- Reduces observer effects
- Good for benthic species

**Aerial Surveys:**
- Visual observation from aircraft
- Limited to shallow, clear water
- Fast coverage of large areas
- Good for surface schooling species

**Advantages:**
- Direct observation (reduced assumptions)
- Species identification possible
- Behavioral information

**Disadvantages:**
- High labor cost
- Limited to specific conditions
- Depth and visibility constraints

### 2.6 Population Estimation Models

**Statistical Catch-at-Age Models:**
- Fit population models to catch and survey data
- Estimate population numbers by age and time
- Account for fishing mortality and natural mortality
- Provide uncertainty estimates

**Integrated Assessment Models:**
- Combine multiple data sources (catch, CPUE, surveys, biology)
- Increase precision of estimates through data integration
- Common models: CASAL, Stock Synthesis, ADMB

**Bayesian Approaches:**
- Incorporate prior knowledge about population parameters
- Provide posterior distributions of population estimates
- Better uncertainty quantification

**Virtual Population Analysis (VPA):**
- Back-calculate cohort abundance from catch and natural mortality
- Limited to data with strong age structure

### 2.7 Biomass Indices and Standardized Indices

**Simple Biomass Indices:**
- Aggregate CPUE across fleets or time periods
- Index of relative abundance
- Assumes catchability constant

**Standardized Indices:**
- Remove effects of:
  - Seasonal variation
  - Vessel and gear differences
  - Environmental variables
- More reliable trend indicators

**Abundance Indices vs. Biomass Indices:**
- **Abundance index:** Number of fish per unit effort
- **Biomass index:** Weight per unit effort
  - More relevant for fisheries management
  - Accounts for size differences

**Index Combination:**
- Multiple indices increased reliability
- Weighted by inverse variance
- Accounts for different spatial and temporal coverage

## Synthesis: Choosing Methods

### Decision Framework

| Situation | Recommended Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Large pelagic stock | Acoustic + CPUE standardization |
| Small demersal stock | Trawl survey + tagging |
| Commercial fishery with long history | CPUE standardization |
| Data-limited situation | Visual survey + simple models |
| High-value species | Multiple methods for comparison |

### Best Practices

1. **Use multiple methods** - Cross-validation improves confidence
2. **Standardize protocols** - Ensures comparability over time
3. **Include uncertainty** - All estimates have limits
4. **Regular calibration** - Maintain data quality
5. **Integrate data sources** - Combine for maximum information

## Conclusion

Estimating fish stock abundance requires understanding both the biological characteristics of the stock and the strengths/limitations of available methods. No single method is perfect; successful stock assessment typically combines multiple approaches to maximize accuracy and precision of estimates.
