## Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM) Formula

$$SSB = \frac{P_0 \times A}{R \times S \times F}$$

Where:
- **SSB** = Spawning stock biomass
- **$P_0$** = Daily egg production per unit area
- **$A$** = Spawning area
- **$R$** = Sex ratio (proportion female)
- **$S$** = Spawning fraction (proportion spawning per day)
- **$F$** = Batch fecundity (eggs per spawning female)

---

## Question 1: Basic Calculation

A sardine spawning survey in Tanzanian coastal waters collected the following data:

- Daily egg production per unit area ($P_0$) = 450 eggs/m²/day
- Spawning area ($A$) = 5,000 km²
- Sex ratio ($R$) = 0.52 (52% female)
- Spawning fraction ($S$) = 0.35 (35% spawn per day)
- Batch fecundity ($F$) = 12,000 eggs/female

**Calculate the spawning stock biomass (SSB).**

### Answer:

First, convert spawning area to m²:
$$A = 5,000 \text{ km}^2 = 5,000 \times 10^6 \text{ m}^2 = 5 \times 10^9 \text{ m}^2$$

Apply DEPM formula:
$$SSB = \frac{450 \times 5 \times 10^9}{0.52 \times 0.35 \times 12,000}$$

$$SSB = \frac{2.25 \times 10^{12}}{2,184} = 1.03 \times 10^9 \text{ eggs}$$

Converting to biomass (sardine eggs ~0.75 mg = 0.00075 g per egg):
$$1.03 \times 10^9 \text{ eggs} \times 0.00075 \text{ g/egg} = 7.73 \times 10^8 \text{ g}$$

Convert to tonnes (1 tonne = $10^6$ g):
$$\frac{7.73 \times 10^8 \text{ g}}{10^6 \text{ g/tonne}} = 773 \text{ tonnes}$$

$$SSB \approx 773 \text{ tonnes}$$

## Question 2: Parameter Interpretation

**Explain what each parameter in the DEPM formula represents and why it is important for SSB estimation.**

### Answer:

- **$P_0$ (Daily Egg Production)**: Measures spawning intensity in the survey area. Higher $P_0$ indicates active spawning; reflects reproductive output per unit spawning habitat.

- **$A$ (Spawning Area)**: Geographic extent of the spawning ground. Larger area = greater total egg production. Accurate delineation is critical.

- **$R$ (Sex Ratio)**: Only females produce eggs. Must adjust for proportion of females in spawning population. Typically 0.48-0.52 depending on species.

- **$S$ (Spawning Fraction)**: Not all females spawn on a given day. Varies by species and environmental conditions. Lower $S$ = smaller daily fraction of stock spawning.

- **$F$ (Batch Fecundity)**: Individual female reproductive capacity. Higher $F$ = fewer females needed to produce observed eggs. Critical parameter often determined from histological analysis.

**Importance**: Each parameter affects SSB inversely or directly. Small errors in any parameter compound to large SSB estimation errors.

## Question 3: Sensitivity Analysis

**If spawning fraction ($S$) decreases from 0.40 to 0.25 due to poor environmental conditions, how does this affect SSB estimates? What does this imply biologically?**

### Answer:

**Effect on SSB:**

With $S = 0.40$: Denominator = $0.52 \times 0.40 \times 12,000 = 2,496$

With $S = 0.25$: Denominator = $0.52 \times 0.25 \times 12,000 = 1,560$

$$\frac{\text{SSB}_{new}}{\text{SSB}_{old}} = \frac{2,496}{1,560} = 1.60$$

**SSB increases by 60%** for same number of observed eggs.

**Biological Implication:**

If fewer females spawn per day ($S$ decreases), a **larger total stock is required** to produce the observed daily egg production. This indicates:

- **Reduced spawning activity** per individual female
- Possible **physiological stress** (food scarcity, temperature extremes, pollution)
- **Recruitment failure** or poor condition of females
- Need for **management intervention** (reduced fishing pressure)

## Question 4: Data Collection Problem

**A researcher estimates spawning stock biomass using DEPM but realizes the sex ratio in the spawning population differs from the population overall. How would this bias SSB estimates?**

### Answer:

**Scenario 1: Actual $R$ > Assumed $R$**

If more females spawn than assumed:
- Denominator is **underestimated**
- SSB estimates are **inflated** (overestimate of true stock)
- Result: More liberal catch recommendations (dangerous)

**Scenario 2: Actual $R$ < Assumed $R$**

If fewer females spawn than assumed:
- Denominator is **overestimated**
- SSB estimates are **deflated** (underestimate of true stock)
- Result: More conservative catch recommendations (safer)

**Why This Matters:**

Sex ratio bias directly affects SSB by factor of (assumed $R$ / actual $R$). A 10% error in sex ratio causes ~10% error in SSB.

**Solution:** 
- Sample spawning ground directly
- Use separate sex ratio estimates from spawning area
- Conduct sensitivity analysis on $R$ uncertainty

## Question 5: Application Question

**A small pelagic fishery in Zanzibar wants to set catch limits based on SSB estimates from DEPM. What assumptions must be met for this method to be reliable?**

### Answer:

**Biological Assumptions:**

1. **Pelagic eggs**: Eggs develop in water column (accessible to sampling). Not suitable for demersal or adhesive eggs.

2. **Defined spawning area**: Spawning concentrated in identifiable, accessible location. Not dispersed throughout stock range.

3. **Synchronous spawning**: Most females spawn within defined period (season/month).

4. **Steady-state stock**: Population not experiencing catastrophic recruitment failure or exceptional year-classes.

**Data Assumptions:**

5. **Accurate fecundity ($F$)**: Must be determined from gonad analysis of spawning females. Not from historical literature.

6. **Accurate sex ratio ($R$)**: Sampled directly from spawning grounds, not from general population.

7. **Accurate spawning fraction ($S$)**: Requires histological analysis or mark-recapture on spawning ground.

8. **Representative $P_0$ sampling**: Survey must cover entire spawning area, account for spatial patchiness.

**Oceanographic Assumptions:**

9. **Negligible egg mortality**: Assumes eggs survive until next sampling occasion (typically <24 hours).

10. **No egg advection**: Spawned eggs remain in survey area (weak currents).

**If assumptions violated:**

- SSB estimates become unreliable
- Catch recommendations may be inappropriate
- Use sensitivity analysis or combine with other methods (acoustic, VPA, CPUE)

## Question 6: Comparative Assessment

**Compare DEPM with other spawning stock biomass estimation methods (mark-recapture, acoustic surveys, VPA). What are relative advantages and disadvantages?**

### Answer:

| Method | Data Needs | Cost | Accuracy | Time Scale | Best For |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| **DEPM** | Fecundity, sex ratio, egg production | High | High | 1-2 seasons | Small pelagics with defined spawning |
| **Acoustic** | Calibrated echo sounder | High | Medium | Days-weeks | Pelagic schools, real-time |
| **Mark-Recapture** | Tagging program | Medium | Medium | Weeks-months | Discrete populations, movement |
| **VPA** | Catch-at-age, M estimate | Low | Medium | Long-term | Multiple data sources, retrospective |

**DEPM Advantages:**
- Direct spawning stock estimate (not index)
- Theoretically sound biological basis
- Works when catch data unreliable

**DEPM Disadvantages:**
- Very data-intensive
- Sensitive to parameter uncertainty
- Species-specific requirements
- Expensive and labor-intensive

**Recommendation:** Use DEPM combined with 1-2 other methods for cross-validation.

## Question 7: Real Data Problem

**Given the following data from a Zanzibar anchovy spawning survey:**

- Survey area: 2,500 km²
- Average daily egg production: 320 eggs/m²
- Sex ratio: 0.50
- Spawning fraction: 0.30
- Batch fecundity: 8,500 eggs/female
- Survey duration: 5 days
- Total catch during survey: 150 tonnes

**Calculate:**

a) Spawning stock biomass
b) Exploitation rate (Catch/SSB)
c) Is this sustainable? (Assume target exploitation rate = 10%)

### Answer:

**a) Calculate SSB:**

$$SSB = \frac{320 \times 2,500 \times 10^6}{0.50 \times 0.30 \times 8,500}$$

$$SSB = \frac{8 \times 10^{11}}{1,275} = 6.27 \times 10^8 \text{ eggs}$$

Converting to biomass (anchovy eggs ~0.75 mg per egg):
$$6.27 \times 10^8 \text{ eggs} \times 0.00075 \text{ g/egg} = 4.70 \times 10^8 \text{ g} = 470 \text{ tonnes}$$

**SSB = 470 tonnes**

**b) Exploitation Rate:**

$$E = \frac{\text{Catch}}{\text{SSB}} = \frac{150}{470} = 0.319 = 31.9\%$$

**c) Sustainability Assessment:**

- Current exploitation: 31.9%
- Target exploitation: 10%
- **Conclusion**: Stock is **overexploited** at current fishing pressure. Catch should be reduced to ~47 tonnes to meet the 10% target exploitation rate
- This indicates unsustainable harvest levels and need for management intervention
