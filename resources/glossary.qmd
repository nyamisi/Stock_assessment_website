## Stock Assessment Terms

### A

**Abundance Index**
A relative measure of population size derived from survey data or fishery catch-per-unit-effort. Does not provide absolute population size but indicates trends over time.

**Age Determination**
The process of estimating fish age through methods such as otolith reading, scale reading, or vertebral section examination.

**Age-Structured Model**
A stock assessment model that divides the population into age classes and projects each class forward through time, accounting for growth, mortality, and reproduction.

---

### B

**Bycatch**
Fish species or individuals caught incidentally while targeting other species. Often discarded or of lower commercial value.

**Biomass**
Total weight of all fish in a population or stock at a given time.

---

### C

**Catchability (q)**
The proportion of the population in an area that is caught per unit of fishing effort. Ranges from 0 to 1.

**Catch-per-Unit-Effort (CPUE)**
Total catch divided by total fishing effort. Used as an index of fish abundance (CPUE = q × Abundance).

**Catch Assessment Survey (CAS)**
A systematic survey designed to estimate total catch from a fishery based on sampling landing sites or fishing effort and using raising factors.

**Coefficient of Variation (CV)**
Standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the mean. Used to measure relative variability in estimates.

---

### D

**Discard**
Fish that are caught but returned to the sea, either dead or alive. Often occurs when catch regulations are exceeded or fish have low market value.

**Discardability**
The proportion of catch that is discarded.

---

### E

**Effort**
A measure of fishing intensity, including number of vessels, fishing time, gear quantity, or other measures of fishing activity.

**Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)**
A zone extending 200 nautical miles from a country's coastline where the country has exclusive rights to exploit natural resources.

---

### F

**Fishery-Dependent Data**
Data collected directly from the fishing process itself, including landing records, onboard observer data, and fisher reports.

**Fishery-Independent Data**
Data collected through research activities independent of the fishing process, such as research surveys and tagging experiments.

**Fecundity**
The number of eggs produced by a female fish, often related to body size.

**Frame Survey**
A census-based survey that collects data on all fishing vessels, gear, and landing sites to establish a sampling frame and generate raising factors.

---

### G

**Gear Selectivity**
The property of fishing gear to catch fish of certain sizes more readily than others. Typically expressed as a selectivity curve.

**Gonad**
The reproductive organ in fish. Examination of gonad development determines maturity status.

---

### H

**Harvest Rate**
The proportion of the population removed by fishing in a given time period (usually annually).

---

### L

**Landing Records**
Official records of fish catch that are landed and sold at ports. The most common source of fishery-dependent data.

**Length-Weight Relationship**
A mathematical relationship between fish length and weight, typically expressed as W = aL^b.

---

### M

**Maturity Staging**
Classification of fish gonad development (immature, maturing, mature, spent) to determine reproductive status.

**Mortality**
The rate at which fish are lost from a population. Includes natural mortality, fishing mortality, and other causes.

---

### O

**Onboard Observer**
A government personnel who rides aboard fishing vessels to collect catch, bycatch, discard, and other data.

**Otolith**
The ear bone of fish used for age determination. Growth rings (annuli) indicate age similar to tree rings.

---

### P

**Portside Sampling**
Collection of biological data (length, age, sex, maturity) from a sample of catch at landing sites.

**Population Parameter**
A characteristic of the population such as abundance, growth rate, mortality rate, or reproduction rate.

---

### R

**Raising Factor**
A multiplier used to expand sample data to population estimates. Calculated as the ratio of population size to sample size.

**Recruitment**
The addition of new, juvenile fish to the exploitable population through reproduction and growth.

**Reference Point**
A target or limit value for a population parameter (e.g., biomass, harvest rate) used in fisheries management.

---

### S

**Sampling Frame**
A complete listing of all units (e.g., vessels, landing sites) in a population from which a sample is drawn.

**Selectivity Curve**
A mathematical function describing how gear selectivity varies with fish size.

**Sexual Maturity**
The developmental stage when fish become capable of reproduction.

**Standardization**
A statistical process to adjust catch-per-unit-effort data for effects of non-biological factors (vessel characteristics, season, environmental conditions) to obtain a more accurate abundance index.

**Stock**
A population of fish of the same species in a geographic area that shares similar ecological characteristics and is managed as a unit.

**Stock Assessment**
An evaluation of the current status and trends of a fish stock using collected data and mathematical models.

**Surplus Production**
The amount of biomass growth available for sustainable harvest from a population.

---

### V

**Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)**
Electronic device that automatically records and transmits the location of a fishing vessel, used for monitoring fishing effort and spatial distribution.

**Von Bertalanffy Growth Equation**
The standard mathematical model for describing fish growth: L(t) = L∞(1 - e^(-K(t-t0)))

---

### Y

**Year Class**
All fish born during the same breeding season or calendar year.
